# Easy-Eagler-Server

A eagler server for fucking noobs, if you need it :3 but really for anyone!

Free Server Host List: https://fmhl.berserk.sbs
Support Discord: https://discord.gg/tCuJvM7XJf

# Setup: 
First use a decent host such as tick hosting https://tickhosting.xyz/ or bisect hosting https://www.bisecthosting.com/curseforge?curseforge_project_id=1279853&dl=1 paid servers are better than the free ones (true for all hosts)!

### Before you upload the zip!
- write down/remember what the server.jar paper.jar (the only .jar) is named
